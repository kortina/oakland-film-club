*Fight Club* is another classic like *The Matrix* which I view as a sort of 'total package' movie (vs *They Live*, which while an awesome premise, isn't exactly hitting my bar on every dimension for a great movie).

What I think is important about this 'total package' type of movie is that it can serve as an entry point
for pretty serious / fundamental / hard intellectual questions.

*Fight Club* and *The Matrix* were certainly this for me in high school, and I'm sure played no small role in my decision to study political philosophy in college.

What struck me this viewing of *Fight Club* was how much of a critique of the left I now see in it -- I have a great deal of sympathy for the critique of the dominant institutions,
but my issue with a lot of critiques is that they don't present a real positive alternative direction / imagine a working better reality. I kind of see *Fight Club* as making
this critique of the left, asking the question: *but what happens after the revolution?*
