I first heard about _Hedwig_ when I moved to NYC about a year after college, from my boss at work. I think this was around the time NPH was doing _Hedwig_ on Broadway.

But for some reason I didn't get around watching til 2019 -- and this was probably my favorite movie I saw that year.

It deals with universal questions of love and identity, and it's heartbreaking and hilarious and different and above all FUN.
