I just watched this interview with Tarantino where the interviewer says _The Searchers_ was his
'father / son Western' and Tarantino responds that _The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly_ was the
Western he shared with his dad.

My dad and I watched a few Westerns together (_The Outlaw Josey Wales_, _Tombstone_, _Silverado_)
but were more into mob movies as a genre. _Once Upon in A Time_ was a favorite we shared, I think
because it was more of an 'outsider' / 'cult' film--we liked _The Godfather_ (1 & 2) and
_Goodfellas_ and _A Bronx Tale_, but everyone liked those.

The other thing that I think was captivating for us about _Once Upon a Time in America_ was how
challenging it is. It's slow. It's long (like 4 hours, one of the longest movies I have ever
seen, though it doesn't feel it). It's disjointed with lots of time hopping.

And it's a noir. As an audience, we're trying to piece together the same story about a mysterious
note and missing money from a hidden suitcase as the protagonist, Noodles.

Just as Leone inverts the typical noir trope of a detective protagonist by using a syndicate crime
backdrop and cast of characters, he also inverts the trope of the femme fatale, casting Deborah as an
aspiring dancing and actor, that we first encounter in all white (actually, who is almost always
dressed in white) practicing ballet.

The primary source of tension in the film is not the broader conflict involving the mob / union /
police / city, but the more intimate struggle between Deborah, Max, and Noodles. Noodles sits
between Max and Deborah, each demanding his devotion, while each pursuing their own grand ambitions and constantly choosing to prioritize these over their relationship with him.

Noodles, while not a saint, seems to have some sort of moral center grounded in the value he
finds in his friendships and relationships, and his willingness to sacrifice his power and freedom
for the sake of these.

The final shot of the film, a big grin on Noodles' face after he gets high in the opium den, is
perplexing, and leaves me wondering what Leone thinks of the values, the viability of the values,
of each of these characters.
