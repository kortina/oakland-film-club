*Man on Wire* is one of those intoxicating, absurd adventures with no real point other than the pursuit of the sublime -- it's amazing in the same way as *Fitzcarraldo* or *The Burden of Dreams*.
It is prolly my favorite doc other than *Burden of Dreams* or maybe *The Act of Killing.*

Cf. my [remarks on Apollo 11 and First Man](https://oaklandfilmclub.com/posts/apollo-11/).
