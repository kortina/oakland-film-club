It has been years since I have seen *The Matrix*, and it really held up -- with lots of new things to think about even though I have seen it many times in the past.

The main thing I was thinking about this time was Cypher -- how attractive is it to 'un-know' our bleak reality and choose a more palatable one?

There are many religious overtones *The Matrix* (eg with Neo as a sort of savior figure), but I find the religious impulse in Cypher most compelling.
The title of a documentary about *Camus* comes to mind: *The Madness of Sincerity.*
How sweet it would be to forget our existential despair:

> CYPHER
> You know, I know that this steak
> doesn't exist. I know when I put
> it in my mouth, the Matrix is
> telling my brain that it is juicy
> and delicious. After nine years,
> do you know what I've realized?
> He shoves it in, eyes rolling up, savoring the tender
> beef melting in his mouth.
> 
> CYPHER
> Ignorance is bliss.
> Agent Smith watches him chew the steak loudly, smacking
> it between his teeth.
> 
> CYPHER
> Mmm so, so goddamn good.

I read this choice Cypher makes as the same sort of choice one might make to believe there is something more / better than our short lives full of suffering.
I actually wonder if I really had the same full choice as Cypher if I wouldn't act differently -- the problem is,
we do not actual have this choice -- while we might adopt some sort of religious belief in an alternative, we do not
have the same ability to un-know our reality that Cypher would via the deal with the Agents.
