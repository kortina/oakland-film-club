When I was a kid, every Friday night we used to go to the local pizza spot (Frank and Nick's), get a pie, and rent a movie from the video shop that was next door.

The store was arranged by genre, and I had a bias towards the "Action" section. Since this was the late 80s / early 90s we are talking, that meant things like the _Missing in Action_ franchise from Chuck Norris, stuff from Steven Seagal like _Under Siege_, Sly Stallone movies like _Tango and Cash_ (which I mentioned in the writeups for
[Fargo](/posts/film-club-14-fargo/)
and
[Foxy Brown](https://oaklandfilmclub.com/posts/film-club-24-foxy-brown/)
), the _Die Hard_ franchise from Bruce Willis, etc.

Upon further reflection, I had a specific bias toward what maybe I would have called "Serious Action," which meant it was not as campy as a series like _Lethal Weapon_ with Danny Glover and Mel Brooks.

So naturally, I tended to go for "serious" kung fu flicks like Jet Li's _Fist of Legend_ or Ang Lee's _Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon_, over campier stuff, like Jackie Chan. (The Bruce canon is tough to place now -- while it was serious and I always had a deep respect for Bruce Lee, both in terms of his physical skill and his philosophy -- his [Liberate Yourself from Classical Karate](https://blackbeltmag.com/liberate-yourself-from-classical-karate) remains today one of my favorite essays -- I think I found something about the dubbing of his films particularly tough to enjoy.)

These days I find myself returning again and again to Jackie Chan's films (as opposed to the "serious" films I enjoyed as a kid -- "I was so much older than, I'm younger than that now..").

Partly, maybe, this is my sort of frustration with the "monomyth" -- Joseph Campell's _Hero with a Thousand Faces_ is always on the same journey -- and that narrative just doesn't see to map to a lot of the hard problems of modernity,
as Rob and I explored to death in our [Civilization Noir](https://kortina.nyc/civilization-noir-film/) film.

Partly, too, though, I think this is just a much deeper sense of respect for Jackie Chan's art, his sense of humor, his choreography. (Btw, if you have not seen it, you should definitely check out the [Every Frame a Painting on Jackie Chan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1PCtIaM_GQ)).

What I like about Jackie Chan's humor -- other than the fact that it is generally brilliant and hilarious -- is that
it's not mean. I talked about the idea of dad jokes in the [Paddleton](https://oaklandfilmclub.com/posts/film-club-16-paddleton/) write-up, and I think my reaction here is similar.

I think other people must have had the same discovery, because Tik Tok is awesome in the same way -- physical humor is kind of universal, and it's safer -- I think people have (in many cases rightly) learned to be a little more thoughtful about the jokes they make, but it seems also people are afraid to tell jokes and laugh, and physical humor is a great way to do this.

Here's one of my favorite examples I've come across recently:
