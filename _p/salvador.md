Sean picked  this week's movie, *Salvador*, which I had never heard of. I also have not seen *Platoon*, which was Sean's motive for picking, because
Oliver Stone credits *Salvador* as his training ground that gave him skills to make *Platoon*.

What was pleasantly surprising to me knowing nothing about *Salvador* and kind of expecting more of a war movie with 2 hours of soldiers in the jungle
was how much of this movie was embedded in the streets and local culture. There was both a real love for the people off Salvador and a deep sadness
about how they get caught up in this struggle between distant world powers that feel nothing for the people suffering the consequences of war.
