My favorite movie from Sundance 2020 (John Was Trying to Contact Aliens) just came out on Netflix, so I think this will be a fun oppy to screen a bunch of shorts. I will probably add a few more to this list:

[Thunder Road](https://vimeo.com/174957219) (13 min)

[Funnel](https://vimeo.com/125551582) (7 min)

[The Robbery](https://vimeo.com/205973976) (10 min)

[Confusion Through Sand](https://vimeo.com/117249231) (9 min)

[Valerio's Day Out](https://youtu.be/JSBn7lrsg8g) (8 min)

[La Jetee](https://vimeo.com/309034119) (28 min)

[John Was Trying to Contact Aliens](https://www.netflix.com/title/81252991) (16 min)
