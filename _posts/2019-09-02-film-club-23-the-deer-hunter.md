When I watch *The Deer Hunter*, I really feel the contrast between two versions of reality, the
intense combat experience and the carefully constructed and delicate social fabric of domestic
reality the veterans seek to reintegrate into.

One of the things I have heard in conversations with veterans who have been in combat is that it is
not just the haunting memories of the horror of war that make the reintegration difficult.

There is a dullness in the absence of an intense mode of constant vigilance and heightened
perception that you maintain when the threat of danger is ever present. And, there is a missing
sense of camaraderie, the bond shared between soldiers who each understand how much their lives
depend upon the support of their fellows, which is not quite replicable in most domestic
relationships.

Sometimes I wonder if PTSD is rampant among doctors and nurses, given how much they are exposed to
death. But I also wonder if there is a different sort of effect, since the doctors and nurses are
holding patient lives in their hands, but the medical staff members are not co-dependent on each
other for their own survival.

Likewise, when I watched *Apollo 11* recently, I was wondering if the astornauts suffered from some
sort of PTSD, and I ended up learning that Buzz Aldrin had a really hard time reintegrating after
the mission. He suffered from depression and alcholism.
