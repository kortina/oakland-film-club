When I watch _The Deer Hunter_, I really feel the contrast between two versions of reality, the
intense combat experience and the carefully constructed and delicate social fabric of domestic
reality the veterans seek to reintegrate into.
If _Heart of Darkness_ is the version of the story were the horror pushes Marlowe into self exile in the
jungle, _The Deer Hunter_ is the version where the protagonist tries to return to civilization and
brings back the horror with him.

One of the things I have heard in conversations with veterans who have been in combat is that it is
not just the haunting memories of the horror of war that make the reintegration difficult.

There is a dullness in the absence of an intense mode of constant vigilance and heightened
perception that you maintain when the threat of danger is ever present. And, there is a missing
sense of camaraderie, the bond shared between soldiers who each understand how much their lives
depend upon the support of their fellows, which is not quite replicable in most domestic
relationships.

I don't want to glorify war or diminish the horror and brutality and senselessness of it, but I
also wonder about the spectrum of reactions to it. I wonder how much of the struggle of
reintegration is the inability to forget the senseless violence vs how much of it is a
recognition of some sort of peak intensity of experience on a different plane of reality that
you know you will never feel again. I guess I wonder if there is some sort of weird regret or
nostalgia aspect to it.

To try to disentangle this tought a bit... Doctors and nurses are exposed to death everyday, and I'm sure they experience some form of PTSD and numbing to a senselessness that most of us are not daily exposed to. But the ER experience differs from combat, since the doctors and nurses are holding patient lives in their hands, but the medical staff members are not co-dependent on each other for their own survival.

Contrast this to something like the moon mission. When I watched _Apollo 11_ recently, I was wondering if the astronauts suffered from some sort of PTSD, and I ended up learning that Buzz Aldrin had a really hard time reintegrating after the mission. He suffered from depression and alcoholism.

In the space case, the senseless violence is missing, but the heightened sense of danger and
reliance on your comrades is present, where pretty much every second you understand that you have
placed your own survival directly in the hands of the person next to you.

There is a level of submission and co-dependence that cannot be paralleled in the everyday
experience of modern civilization.

When I look back at the most vivid memories of my own life, they all involve struggle, and they
all involve struggling alongside a team of people.

And trying to imagine the psychological burden of the combat experience is completely
overwhelming to me. On the one hand, you have this reminder that many of the most horrible and
senseless violence in the world is totally preventable, the result of disagreements between people.
And on the other hand, you have this glimpse of total submission to a collective, a vision of what
the human experience can be at its most selfless, that is behind you, irrecoverable, and a
constant reminder of the dullness of the rest of existence.
