### Pre

Not much of an introduction tonight, just a snippet from the documentary
about Miyazaki, *The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness.*

### Post

When I was in high school, I read a magazine article about *Princess Mononoke* which included some of the frames and started counting the days to the theatrical release.

I don't often read or hear anything about films before their release, so I don't often have this sort of anticipation for a film.
Even when I do know of a film before the release, I rarely get as excited as I was for *Princess Mononoke*.

I saw the film twice in theaters, bought the DVD as soon as it came out, and watched it several more times.
I loved it.

But upon falling in love with *Princess Mononoke*, I did not immediately go down the Miyazaki rabbithole, as I probably would -- and often do -- when I now encounter an auteur.

I think perhaps I didn't immediately realize just how special Miyazaki was upon seeing that first film.

So he fell off my radar, and I didn't think about him much until years later,
when I was in my college dorm room, as a freshman, and I happened to hear about the film when it won the Academy Award
for Best Animated Feature.

I remember feeling a little surprised, because I was a bit more into Anime than the average person
--I had got into it as a kid, always watched the Saturday morning Anime whenever Sci-Fi channel was running it,
and I had rented a bunch of pretty obscure stuff on VHS from the local video shop as a kid,
even bought a few things that I heard about which looked cool but I could not get to see otherwise.

So it seemed odd to me to hear about an Anime from a mainstream source like the Academy Awards,
when I had previously felt like an insider.

Perhaps it was for this reason I had low expectations for the film--if it was mainstream
enough for the Academy, how great could it be?

I believe I got a hold of a screener the night of the Awards and watched it that immediately.

For the first ten minutes, I remember thinking, *yea, it's not another Mononoke...*

But after about thirty minutes, I was transfixed, and felt myself 'spirited away'
into the strange world of the film.

I find very few films that are able to fabricate such an extensive
world from scratch and transport you so far from reality. This feeling is
for me what film can be at its best.

It was perhaps because the film so far exceeded my initially low expectations that
*Spirited Away* was for many years my favorite Miyazaki film, even over *Mononoke*,
which I love.

Years later, I had a similar experience, where I finally got around to watching *Porco Rosso*.
By this point, I had exhausted much of the Miyazaki catalog,
and just hadn't gotten around to *Porco Rosso* because I think
maybe the title got me thinking it would be too much of a story for kids
to be one of his best.

But *Porco Rosso* likewise exceeded all of my expectations, taking me totally by surprise.

I cannot recommend *Porco Rosso* enough if tonight was your first encounter with Miyazaki and you enjoyed the film.

The other film I'll recommend, which is probably my favorite Miyazaki, is *The Wind Rises.*

Enjoy the rabbithole...
