### Pre

This is a classic spaghetti western, directed by Sergio Leone with music by Ennio Morricone.

Unlike a lot of my favorite westerns, Clint Eastwood does not make an appearance (though Leone offered him the role of the protagonist and he turned it down).

### Post

When I was a kid, I was into Westerns. I think my Dad turned me onto them, things like _The
Outlaw Josey Wales_, _Silverado_, and _Tombstone_ ("I'm your huckleberry" is a line that
still kind of gives me goosebumps) come to mind as some of our favorites.
And, of course there was the Steve Martin classic _The Three Amigos._

I would watch some classics like _Shane_ and John Wayne flix when nothing else was on. But I
preferred the 80s shoot-em-ups and anything with Dirty Harry / Clint Eastwood if I had my pick.

I didn't watch a ton of the spaghetti westerns growing up, and did a tour of them when I was in
college or right after, maybe, I think as a result of hearing dope Ennio Morricone tunes in
Tarentino films and taking this inspiration to go deep and see what the spaghetti westerns were all
about.

I remember as a kid having a Smith and Wesson Colt 45 looking cap gun with a plastic belt and
holster and going outside to play cowboys immediately after I watched any Western. I think by the
time I was a kid parents were already dissuading the "cowboys and indians" thing from the 50s
or whenever that was, so we just played black clothes villains against white hilted good guys.

I remember when I started re-visiting the spaghetti westerns via Tarentino wondering why
these westerns were part of the classic film canon--why would an Italian director from the 60s and
70s revisit the sort of cheesy somewhat trashy genre of a decade or more earlier?
