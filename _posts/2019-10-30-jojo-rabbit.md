This week was a miss-schedule, where the original plan was to have Rob present *Woman in the Dunes,*
but we canceled last week due to the train fires and made a mistake with the timing of Rob's
flight this week, so we will be postponing *Woman in the Dunes* and field-tripping it to Kabuki
to see *Jojo Rabbit.*

There won't be a long critical / personal essay for this one since no one has seen it yet.

I will share an interesting bit of an interview with Taika Waititi I heard the other day:

> GROSS: I have the novel your movie is based on sitting right next to me. I haven't read the whole thing. I've read parts of it. It is by no means a comedy. Why did you decide to take this novel and take a lot of liberties with it but also turn it into a comedy?
> 
> WAITITI: Because I don't really know how to do the straight drama and have no real interest in doing that. I think there are plenty of filmmakers who do it very well. And I don't think we need another depressing filmmaker in the world.

This tension is something I have thought about quite a bit myself in my own work -- the world is
pretty bleak, and I want to be honest in anything I do, but at the same time, I agree that we
don't necessarily need more depressing films.

There's a real art to being true to the world and maintaining a sense of humor in your treatment of
it.

This struck me a few weeks ago when I went to see *Lion King* on Broadway. It's really a quite
serious story, with murder and betrayal, questions of governance, the appeal of Waldenponding /
running away to live a wife of 'no worries,' love, death... I recently heard over dinner it's based
on *Hamlet,* one of the best and darkest stories of the Western canon...

And yet, the show *Lion King* manages to maintain a sense of humor, to sing, and dance, and
generally have fun despite the heavy material.

Something to aspire to...
